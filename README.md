# AuLearn25_Assignments

Welcome to the assignments repository of Autonomous Learning in SoSe 2025. It will provide the basic project structure for programming your own Reinforcenment Learning agents for the Python StarCraft 2 environment (PySc2) originally developed by DeepMind!

As the name of our environment suggests: This course focuses on Python and will live in the Python ecosystem, which is basically the standard for research in ML. As our deep learning library of choice, our course will favour PyTorch. You can of course still use another library such as Tensorflow, a Jax-based deep learning library or Keras 3.0, if you prefer. However, we cannot promise to be able to help you in this case.

Before you start programming your own RL agents, a few words of advice: Although especially the more fundamental RL algorithms may not look complex or complicated, implementing them can lead to unforeseen technical problems that may slow you down for a while. You may run into problems that make you wonder whether your implementation is just wrong, your hyperparameters were chosen unwisely, or your agent is just being mean to you. Do not worry. When this happens, we assure you that it is perfectly normal. If you are confused or need help, do not hesitate to ask for help!

Later on, this repository will also include sample solutions for the different assignments. **Note:** There are multiple ways to implement each algorithm and these sample solutions won't be the one and only truth. There might even be ways to improve on them!
