**(Slide 3: What is Learning? A Quick Recap)**

"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our graduate course on Reinforcement Learning! Before we dive deep into the specifics of *reinforcement* learning, let's quickly position it within the broader landscape of machine learning.

You're likely familiar with **Supervised Learning**. Here, the machine learns from a dataset where each data point is explicitly labeled. For instance, you feed it thousands of images of cats and dogs, each tagged with 'cat' or 'dog', and the algorithm learns to classify new, unseen images. The 'supervisor' provides the correct answers.

Then there's **Unsupervised Learning**. In this case, the data is unlabeled. The goal is to discover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships within the data itself. Think of clustering customers into different segments based on their purchasing habits without any predefined groups.

So, where does Reinforcement Learning fit? It's a different beast altogether."

**(Slide 4: Reinforcement Learning - Learning from Interaction)**

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is about learning **what to do**—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical **reward signal**. The learner, or **agent**, is not told which actions to take, as in most forms of machine learning, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them.

**(Image: A simple diagram showing an agent interacting with an environment. Agent takes an action, environment returns a new state and a reward.)**

Think of training a dog. You don't give it a textbook on how to sit. You say 'sit,' and if it sits, you give it a treat (positive reward). If it runs around, you might give a gentle 'no' or no treat (neutral or slightly negative reward). Over time, the dog learns the association between the command 'sit,' its action of sitting, and the positive reward.

RL is fundamentally about learning through trial and error, guided by rewards and punishments. It's learning by *experiencing* the consequences of actions, rather than by being explicitly taught."

**(Slide 5: Core Components of an RL System)**

"At the heart of any RL problem, we have a few key components:

1. **Agent:** The learner and decision-maker. This is the algorithm or system we are trying to make intelligent.
    * *StarCraft II Example:* A single Marine unit, a group of Zerglings, or even the AI controlling an entire Zerg base could be an agent.

2. **Environment:** Everything outside the agent. It's the world the agent interacts with. The agent can influence the environment through its actions.
    * *StarCraft II Example:* The game map, other units (friendly or enemy), buildings, resources, and the game rules themselves constitute the environment.

3. **State ($S_t$):** A representation of the environment at a particular time step $t$. It's the information the agent uses to make decisions. The state should ideally capture all relevant information about the environment needed for decision-making.
    * *StarCraft II Example (MoveToBeacon):* The state could be the (x, y) coordinates of your Marine and the (x, y) coordinates of the Beacon. Or, for a more complex agent, it could be the raw pixel data of the screen, or a feature vector representing unit types, health, locations, etc.

4. **Action ($A_t$):** A choice made by the agent at time $t$, which influences the environment and leads to a new state.
    * *StarCraft II Example (MoveToBeacon):* Actions could be 'move North,' 'move South-East,' 'attack target,' 'build SCV.' The set of available actions might change depending on the state.

5. **Reward ($R_{t+1}$):** A scalar feedback signal received by the agent from the environment after taking action $A_t$ in state $S_t$ and transitioning to state $S_{t+1}$. The agent's objective is to maximize the *cumulative* reward over time.
    * *StarCraft II Example (MoveToBeacon):* +1 reward for reaching the beacon, 0 for all other moves. In a combat scenario, +10 for destroying an enemy unit, -5 for losing a friendly unit, -0.1 for every time step to encourage faster play.

**(Slide 6: The Agent-Environment Interaction Loop)**

"The interaction between the agent and the environment typically proceeds in discrete time steps:

**(Image: A more detailed loop diagram: Agent observes State $S_t$ -> Agent selects Action $A_t$ -> Environment receives $A_t$, transitions to State $S_{t+1}$ and emits Reward $R_{t+1}$ -> Agent observes $S_{t+1}$ and $R_{t+1}$ -> Repeat)**

1. At time $t$, the agent observes the current state of the environment, $S_t$.
2. Based on $S_t$, the agent selects an action, $A_t$.
3. The environment receives action $A_t$. As a result:
    * The environment transitions to a new state, $S_{t+1}$.
    * The environment provides a scalar reward, $R_{t+1}$, to the agent.
4. The agent observes the new state $S_{t+1}$ and the reward $R_{t+1}$.
5. This cycle repeats.

The agent's goal is to learn a **policy**, denoted $\pi$, which is a mapping from states to actions (or probabilities of taking actions). A good policy is one that maximizes the expected cumulative reward."

**(Slide 7: The RL Problem - Sequential Decision Making)**

"The core of the RL problem is **sequential decision making**. This means that actions taken now can affect not just the immediate reward, but also future states and, consequently, all future rewards.

* **Credit Assignment Problem:** If an agent plays a long game of StarCraft and wins, which of the hundreds or thousands of actions it took were crucial for that win? Was it that early scouting Marine, or the perfectly timed attack much later? Assigning credit (or blame) to actions for outcomes that are delayed is a central challenge.
* **Exploration vs. Exploitation Trade-off:**
  * **Exploitation:** The agent uses its current knowledge of the environment to choose actions that it believes will yield the highest immediate or short-term reward. It's like going to your favorite restaurant every time.
  * **Exploration:** The agent tries new, possibly suboptimal, actions to learn more about the environment. It might discover a new action that leads to even higher long-term rewards. It's like trying a new restaurant that might be amazing or terrible.
  * A purely exploitative agent might get stuck in a local optimum. A purely explorative agent might never capitalize on what it has learned. Finding the right balance is critical for effective learning.

**(Slide 8: Examples of RL Applications)**

"RL has seen remarkable success in a variety of domains:

* **Games:**
  * **Classic Games:** Backgammon (TD-Gammon), Chess, Go (AlphaGo, AlphaZero). These demonstrated superhuman performance.
  * **Video Games:** Atari games (Deep Q-Networks), Dota 2 (OpenAI Five), StarCraft II (AlphaStar). These involve complex state and action spaces.
  * *Our focus:* We'll often use StarCraft II mini-games like 'MoveToBeacon' or 'DefeatRoaches' as running examples because they offer a rich, challenging, yet manageable testbed.

* **Robotics:**
  * Learning locomotion gaits for robots.
  * Robot arm manipulation, grasping objects.
  * Autonomous navigation.

* **Control Systems:**
  * Optimizing chemical reactions.
  * Resource management in data centers.
  * Traffic light control.

* **Other Areas:**
  * Personalized recommendations.
  * Financial trading.
  * Healthcare (e.g., optimizing treatment policies).

The common thread is that these are problems where an agent needs to make a sequence of decisions in an environment where the outcomes are uncertain and rewards might be delayed."

**(Slide 9: Why StarCraft II as an Example Domain?)**

"StarCraft II is an excellent domain for studying RL due to its inherent complexities, which mirror many real-world challenges:

* **Large State Space:** The game screen itself is high-dimensional. The number of possible unit configurations and map states is immense.
* **Large Action Space:** Many units, many abilities, many places to click. Actions are often combinatorial.
* **Partial Observability:** You don't see the whole map at once (fog of war).
* **Delayed Rewards:** The outcome of an early strategic decision might only become apparent much later in the game.
* **Multi-agent Aspects:** You control multiple units, and you play against an opponent who is also learning and adapting (though in many mini-games, the opponent is scripted).
* **Long Time Horizons:** Games can last for many minutes, involving thousands of decisions.

Even simplified mini-games in StarCraft II, like 'MoveToBeacon' (navigate a unit to a point) or 'DefeatRoaches' (micro-manage units in a small battle), capture some of these challenges and are great for implementing and testing RL algorithms."
